        Hi, 

        Your friend %{name} is using TrackDons.org to track her donations to projects (NGOs, software projects, crowdfundings). The idea is that if everyone share their donations, we'll give more vissibility to projects and we'll obtain more resources for them. 

        Have you donated recently to any project? Track it and tell it to your friends:

        %{url}

        If you have any comment, just write us to lets@trackdons.org

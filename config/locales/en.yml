        Hi, 

        Your friend %{name} is using TrackDons.org to track her donations to projects (NGOs, software projects, crowdfundings). The idea is that if everyone share their donations, we'll give more vissibility to projects and we'll obtain more resources for them. 

        Have you donated recently to any project? Track it and tell it to your friends:

        %{url}

        If you have any comment, just write us to lets@trackdons.org

        Hi,

        Your friend %{name} has just accepted your invitation to join TrackDons.org. So, two amazing things have just happened: 

        - You can go and greet your friend: %{friend_page}

        - You have a new invitation available. Isn't that fantastic? Think on your next-most-active-donator friend, and call him (err... also remember to invite him)

        We are always happy to hear from fellow donators, reach us at lets@trackdons.org
